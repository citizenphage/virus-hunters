Project Aims Expected Learning Outcomes Your Supervisory Team for this project", " 2021 Third Year Phage Hunters Welcome Phage Hunters! Antimicrobial resistance is a global threat to human health and represents one of the greatest societal challenges of our time. Since their discovery at the turn of the 20th Century, bacteriophages have been used to treat bacterial infections. A contemporary renaissance of phage therapy is underway that offers a powerful tool to complement existing antibiotics and develop the next generation of targeted antimicrobials. Phage therapy depends on the availability of a large and diverse library of isolated phages which are able to kill specific pathogenic bacterial strains. While several countries (Israel, USA, Poland, Georgia, S. Korea, France) are building or consolidating such libraries for human use, no such effort is being undertaken in the UK. Phages for therapeutic use are typically isolated from a limited range of environments such as sewage and agricultural run-off where pathogen abundance is high, but pathogen diversity is narrow. The enormous diversity of phages in other environments remains a vast and untapped resource of potential therapeutics. This is where you come in! During this three week project, you will isolate novel phages against a range of pathogens that cause multi-drug resistant infections. Phages will be isolated from freshwater samples that you collect around campus and the local area. You will purify the phages, extract their DNA for sequencing and then evaluate that sequencing data to determine whether or not a phage is suitable for therapeutic use. If a phage is discovered in your samples, you get to name it and be recorded as its Discoverer! This project is part of a larger Citizen Phage Library project that we recently started to rapidly develop UK capacity for providing phages for clinical use. If you wish, your phages will be recorded as part of this project. It would be super-helpful on for the Citizen Phage Library if you would take lots of photos during the workshop!

The kick-off meeting (Monday 17th May) where you will be handed a sampling pack will take place in at 9:35 am in LSI Seminar Room A. Most lab sessions are scheduled to take about 1-2 hours. Some will take the full three hour period. Due to the tight scheduling, there is not much opportunity to catch-up. Each day of the workshop builds upon the previous day. The schedule is designed so that we can get DNA to the sequencing centre in time for it to be processed with sufficient time after for analysis. Social distancing also prevents us from buddying-up. So, if you miss a day, we will do what we can to catch you up, but there are no guarantees. If you are unable to see your phage isolation all the way through due to unforseen circumstances, you will still be able to participate in the genome annotation and informatics sessions. Safe working practices Each of you will be assigned a pathogen to use for phage isolation. Please make sure you read the appropriate Risk Assessment BEFORE you start handling your cultures. They can be found here. Please also ensure that you have read the appropriate sections of the Risk Assessment document entitled General considerations for working with Containment Level 2 pathogens before performing the work. Working in a COVID-secure manner COVID-19 safety policies remain in place, including face-coverings which must be worn inside University buildings. Social distancing rules remain in place in the lab. Please keep to your work area and be mindful of others when moving around. If you feel unwell, or develop any symptoms associated with COVID19, or if you have a positive test, STAY AWAY It is recommended that you get regularly tested during the workshop. You can book a free test on-campus here. Please enter GP108 by coming up the rear staircase to avoid heavy footfall in the GP lobby. We will make sure the outside door is open so you can get into the lab. You can use the lockers outside for your bags. There are clean lab coats in the lab, which you will wear for your work that day, then put them in the laundry bin when you are finished. There are chemgene spray bottles and blue rolls for you to clean the bench before you start work and after you have completed work before you leave. Aseptic technique We will demonstrate the following in the sessions: Mixing by pipetting Working under a flame. Streaking a host onto agar Demonstrations will occur at the start of each session at 09:40.

This will be held at 9:35 am in LSI Seminar Room A. You will also be provided with a sampling kit containing three jars. The aim is for each student to collect three samples of freshwater. One of these should be from one of the ponds on campus. Try not to all sample the same pond! The other two can be from other sources near your homes or around Exeter. They can include ponds, rivers, bird baths, puddles etc. Each sample will need to be at least 25 mL (each jar holds 40 mL). When picking your sample site, it is worth noting that following heavy rainfall, many wastewater treatment plants have storm overflows that feed into rivers and streams. This makes these regions excellent hunting grounds for new phages. There is a resource for finding such areas (in the interests of water safety) here. If we have rainfall just before sampling, it might be worth considering sites found on this map in the local region. At each sample site, Step 1: Find an interesting sampling site Step 2: Record the location using the What3Words app on your phone.This will be used as the name of the sample. Step 3: Write the three words on the lid of the jar using the waterproof lab pen in your kit, as well as the sample date. Step 4: Fill the jar with water and make sure the lid is tightly fastened. Step 5: Take a photo of the sample site to remind you of what it was you sampled. When you get home, keep the samples in your fridge overnight. Record the details of your sample on the Sample tab on the Google sheet here. Make sure you provide the What3Words address, the date and a brief description of the sample, as well as your name. You do not need to supply a sample number - these will be assigned once all samples are collected. If you want to register your samples as part of the Citizen Phage Library project, you can also register them on the CPL portal. This is currently hosted at the university, so you’ll need to be on the VPN or on University campus. This is currently not working due to a bug, so please record your samples on the Excel spreadsheet and I’ll try and fix it this week so you can record your samples retrospectively. Make sure you are either on campus or on the University VPN Go to this site Click on ‘Sign In’ Click on ‘Sign Up’ Enter a username, email address and choose a password A confirmation email will be sent to your email address - click on the link it contains to complete registration and it should take you to your account page. You need to register your sampling kit before you register samples, so select the ‘Order or register a sampling kit’ button. Find your Sample Kit ID on the side of your sampling kit and type it in (e.g. K-00001) Click submit - this registers that kit ID with your account. For each sample, click on ‘Register your samples’. Enter the What3Words address, the date taken and give a description of the sample. Choose the sample picture for uploading. Your registered Sample Kit should be selected by default. Press Submit. 1.2 Tuesday 18th May The aim of this session is to prepare your samples for phage hunting. This involves removing solid debris and bacteria by centrifugation and filtering, leaving only the phages (which are smaller than the filter size) in the filtrate. Each sample will be aliquoted into 15 aliquots (one per student). At the end, you should have three lots of 15 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. These will then be distributed between the students so each student can test each sample on their designated bacterial host. Step 1: Bring your samples back to the lab Step 2: Transfer each sample to a 50 mL Falcon tube. Fill it up to the 40 mL mark. Samples need to contain the same amount of liquid to ensure balancing in the centrifuge. Label each tube with the sample number and your name. Make sure the lid is securely fastened. Draw an arrow on the lid facing outwards - this will point to where your pellet will be once it has been centrifuged, so you can avoid disturbing it. Step 3: Place your sample in the rack at the front of the lab. These will then be centrifuged for 30 mins at 10,000 x g to pellet the solid material and bacterial cells. The phages will remain in the supernatant because they are much smaller. Step 4: Retrieve your samples from the rack at the front and carefully carry them to your work area, being careful not to disturb the pellet. Step 5: Using a luer-lock syringe, draw up supernatant from one of the samples. Open the syringe filter and lock the syringe into it. Push the syringe down, collecting the filtrate in a fresh tube. You need about 20 mL of filtrate. If the syringe becomes too difficult to push down, it is likely the filter is clogged. To put a new filter on, draw up the syringe slightly so it isn’t dripping, then unlock the syringe filter and fit a fresh one. Step 6: Using a 1000 µL pipettor, transfer 15 aliquots of 1000 µL of sample into 1.5 mL lo-bind microcentrifuge tube. Label the top of the tube with the sample number and your initials. Repeat this process for the remaining samples. When your samples have been aliquoted, take them to the front of the room in the rack. We will then organise them into sample collections for each student. Place your Falcon tubes in the bucket provided - this allows us to clean them and autoclave them for re-use to save on plastic waste. Return your sample jars and sampling kit boxes to the front so they can be reused. 1.3 Wednedsay 19th May The aim of this session is to set up an overnight enrichment of each sample for a pathogen that has been assigned to you. An aliquot of sample is placed into a well in a deep-well plate and mixed with an overnight culture of pathogen and a final concentration of 1 \\(\\times\\) LB medium + 10 mM \\(MgCl_{2}\\) + 30 mM \\(CaCl_{2}\\). Any phages in the sample capable of infecting your pathogen will infect it, undergo the lytic cycle and replicate. Over several cycles of lytic infection, the number of phages for your pathogen will be vastly enriched. In this way, we can isolate rare phages from the environment. To see which pathogen you have been assigned, visit the ‘Assigned Pathogens’ tab on the Google Sheet here Step 1a: Collect your sample pack from the front. This comprises a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube from each sample collected by the students, plus a negative control (autoclaved MilliQ water). Step 1b: Label your 96 well plate with your name and the name of the pathogen using labelling tape. This is so we can return your plate to you from the overnight incubation step. Step 2a: Work out how many wells you need for your samples, plus the negative control. For each sample you have, aliquot 500 µL of 3 \\(\\times\\) LB + 30 mM \\(MgCl_{2}\\) + 30 mM \\(CaCl_{2}\\) into a well. Work in rows, e.g. place one sample in A1, the next in A2, then A3 etc. You should end up with about half your plate containing liquid. You don’t need to change your pipette tip between wells. Step 2b: Change your pipette tip and aliquot 100 µL of pathogen culture into each well that contains liquid. Again, you can use one pipette tip for the whole plate here because the content of each well is identical. Step 2c: Using a fresh pipette tip for each well, Transfer 900 µL of one sample into a well that contains medium plus pathogen. Use the pipette to slowly mix the well. Record the well with the sample number in your lab books. This is critical to track back isolated phages to the samples. Step 2d: Cover the plate with a seal. Step 3: Set up your overnight culture of your pathogen for use tomorrow. To do this, aliquot 10 µL of your culture into a sterilin containing 10 mL of LB medium + 10 mM \\(MgCl_{2}\\) + 10 mM \\(CaCl_{2}\\). Label the sterilin with your name and the name of your pathogen. You can use the short name of the pathogen for this. Step 4: Carefully carry the 96-well plate and the sterilin to the front so we can place it in an incubator overnight at 30 °C. with shaking. 1.3.1 Sewage sample from Countess Wear Sewage is a rich source of phages that infect pathogenic bacteria. To increase the likelihood of finding phages for our pathogens, we have also prepared a sample of filtered, raw sewage using the same method you used for your samples. Raw sewage can contain harmful pathogens such as Hepatitis, so to minimise risk, we have a pre-prepared deep well plate at the front of the class. Each well in that plate contains 900 µL of centrifuged, filtered sewage and 500 µL of 3 \\(\\times\\) LB + 30 mM \\(MgCl_{2}\\) + 30 mM \\(CaCl_{2}\\). All you need to do is aliquot 100 µL of your original pathogen culture into the well designated in the ‘Assigned Sewage Plate Well’ column in the spreadsheet above. PLEASE TAKE CARE TO ALIQUOT YOUR PATHOGEN INTO THE CORRECT WELL. If we end up with two pathogens in the same well, we won’t know which one has phages enriched for it. 1.4 Thursday 20th May Following overnight growth, the cultures in the deep-well plate should now be enriched in phages infecting your pathogen, provided they were in the original sample. Each well will also contain substances from the original sample that made it through the 0.2 µm filter. In this next step, we will start to culture the phages against their pathogen in pure culture. We filter material from the deep-well plate through a 0.45 µm filter into a fresh plate, then add that filtrate to a fresh culture (the reason we use a 0.45 µm filter instead of a 0.2 µm filter is simply due to cost - they are much cheaper!). This is a two-stage process to ensure the phage can be propagated in pure culture. Step 1a: Collect your deep-well plate from the front, as well as your overnight culture and return it to your work area. Step 1b: Open up a 0.45 µm filter plate and place it on top of a sterile 96-well plate. Write your name and pathogen directly on the bottom plate. Use label tape to tape the two plates together at the edge, just to stop them slipping apart. Step 1c: Transfer 200 µL from each well into the same well position on the filter plate. It is important that you don’t pipette into a wrong well, so we can track which phages came from which samples, so work slowly and carefully. If you do make a mistake, make a note of it in your lab books so we can correct the error in the final stages. Step 1d: Cover your filter plate with a seal and return it to the front. Step 2: Our technicians will take your plate up to the 4th floor for centrifugation at 900 \\(\\times g\\) for 4 minutes. This will transfer the phage lysate into the bottom plate, but keep the pathogens in the top plate. The bottom plate is then used to infect fresh cultures. Step 3a: Make a stock culture by adding 500 µL of overnight host culture into 9.5 mL of LB + 10 mM \\(MgCl_{2}\\) + 10 mM \\(CaCl_{2}\\). Mix briefly by vortexing for 1-2 seconds. Step 3b: Label your a fresh, sterile 200 µL 96-well plate with your name and pathogen. Into each well add 200 µL of the stock culture from the step above per well in as many wells as you have samples (including the negative control). Like before work in rows so that it matches your deep-well plate. Change your pipette tip every row and briefly revortex your stock culture to bring it back into resuspension. Step 4a: Using a different pipette tip for each well, transfer 5 µL of phage lysate from each well of your bottom plate from Step 2 into the same well position on the plate containing LB + 10 mM \\(MgCl_{2}\\) + 10 mM \\(CaCl_{2}\\) host culture. Mix by pipetting. Again, if you make a mistake, make a note of it in your lab books so we can correct the error in the final stages. Step 4b: Seal your plate with a plate seal. Step 5: Return your 96-well plate and your remaining stock culture to the front. We’ll use the remaining stock culture to inoculate the sewage plate. The 96-well plate will be incubated overnight at 37 °C. 1.5 Friday 21st May In this session, we will complete the second stage of the propagation in pure culture. It is very similar to what was done the previous day, but using our 200 µL culture plate instead of a deep-well plate. We will also prepare a streak plate for continuing the work next week. Step 1a: Collect your plate from the front, as well as your overnight culture and return it to your work area. Step 1b: Open up a 0.45 µm filter plate and place it on top of a sterile 96-well plate. Write your name and pathogen directly on the bottom plate. Use label tape to tape the two plates together at the edge, just to stop them slipping apart. Step 1c: Transfer 200 µL from each well into the same well position on the filter plate. It is important that you don’t pipette into a wrong well, so we can track which phages came from which samples, so work slowly and carefully. If you do make a mistake, make a note of it in your lab books so we can correct the error in the final stages. Step 1d: Cover your filter plate with a seal and return it to the front. Step 2: Our technicians will take your plate up to the 4th floor for centrifugation at 900 \\(\\times g\\) for 4 minutes. Step 3: Retrieve your plate from the front and separate it from the filter plate. Cover the bottom plate with a seal. This will be used next week in the plaque assays. Step 4: Make a fresh streak plate of your culture. Flame an inoculation loop until it glows red and then allow it to cool. Pick 3-4 colonies from your overnight streak plate by dabbing the loop on them. Streak them down one side of a petri dish containing LB + agar. Reflame your loop, allow to cool and drag one side perpendicular to the original streak. Turn your plate 90° and repeat. Step 5: Return your streak petri dish and sealed phage lysate plates to the front. We will store the phage lysate at 4 °C over the weekend and incubate the petri dish culture. "],["spot-assays-and-purification.html", "Week 2 Spot Assays and Purification 2.1 Monday 24th May 2.2 Tuesday 25th May 2.3 Wednesday 26th May 2.4 Thursday 27th May 2.5 Friday 28th May", " Week 2 Spot Assays and Purification Last week, you prepared samples by enriching any phages that might be present for your pathogen. This week, we get to find out if your samples contained any suitable phages. We do this using something called a spot assay. Briefly, we add 5 µL of enriched viral lysate to a lawn of host culture. If there are suitable viruses present in the lysate, they will infect the cells in the lawn and start to replicate. Each round of replication releases more viruses, and a plaque begins to form, spreading outwards in a circular fashion from the initial infection. If you’re interested in how plaques form, I recommend reading the paper by (Abedon and Yin 2009). 2.1 Monday 24th May Today, we set up the first spot assay to see if we have any viruses in your samples. To make the lawn of bacteria, you need to combine an exponentially growing host with soft agar, then pour it onto a bottom plate and swirl it round for even coverage. You need to work quickly. The molten agar is above the thermal tolerance of most host bacteria, so we need to minimise the time the host spends in hot agar. Once on the bottom plate, the hot agar sets quickly, so you need to swirl quickly to get even coverage before it solidifies. We’ve set up three pouring stations with water baths containing glass test tubes with 3 mL molten top agar in them. Students will come up in turn and pour their host lawns. You’ll have one extra plate for a practice pour. - [ ] Step 1: Make a fresh streak plate of your culture. Flame an inoculation loop until it glows red and then allow it to cool. Pick 3-4 colonies from your overnight streak plate by dabbing the loop on them. Streak them down one side of a petri dish containing LB + agar. Reflame your loop, allow to cool and drag one side perpendicular to the original streak. Turn your plate 90° and repeat. Label with your name, date and host name. Step 2: Make a fresh overnight culture for tomorrow’s plaque assays. Flame an inoculation loop until it glows red and then allow it to cool. Pick 3-4 colonies from your overnight streak plate by dabbing the loop on them. Transfer the loop into fresh LB medium in a sterilin. Reflame your loop. Label the sterilin with your name, date and host name. Bring the new streak plate and overnight culture to the front for us to incubate. Step 3: Collect your plate of phage lysates from last week and a culture of your host at \\(OD_{600}\\) of 0.6. You will also need 4 bottom agar plates. You’ll also need to collect a microcentrifuge tube of the phage lysate for your host from the chicken sample (C), and a microcentrifuge tube of the phage lysate for your host from the sewage sample (S). Step 4: You’ll be putting 12 spots per plate (one per sample). I find the easiest way to do this is to divide your plate into quadrants, and then place three spots per quadrant. Draw two perpendicular bisecting lines on the bottom of each plate with a ruler to divide it into quadrants. Mark one edge with an arrow so we can orientate it. Label each plate with your name, the host bacterium, the date, and Plate 1 through Plate 3. Label the last plate Practice. On your three numbered plates, write the numbers of the samples where you are going to put them in the quadrants as shown here: where B is where you’ll put your blank, C is where you’ll put your chicken sample and S is where you’ll put your sewage sample. Step 5a: Bring your labelled plates and host culture to a pouring station. We’ll walk you through the process. Briefly vortex your host culture (1-2 seconds) to resuspend it. Under a blue flame, put your practice plate in front of you and take off the lid. Take the cap off of a tube of molten agar, but leave it in the water bath. Use a pipette to suck up 1 mL of host culture into a blue tip. Using the other hand, take the tube of molten agar out of the bath and add the 1 mL of culture to it. Immediately vortex the agar (1-2 seconds) to mix and pour quickly but smoothly into the centre of the practice plate. If there are any bubbles in the tube, they’ll come out last, and you want to leave them in the tube. Quickly place the tube into the waste beaker and swirl the plate to ensure even coverage of the agar across the surface. Put the lid back on the plate, but leave it with the agar on the bottom to allow the top agar to set. Slide the plate over to one side and repeat with your remaining three plates. Note the time or set a timer for 15 minutes. Step 5b: After 15 minutes, collect your plates (the top agar should now be set) and take them back to your work area. Spot assays work best if the phages are added shortly after the top agar has set. Step 6a: Under a blue flame, open up Plate 1 and spot 5 µL of sample from the first eleven samples of your 96 well plate, plus your blank onto their appropriate locations on the plate. To do this, gently push the liquid out of the pipette over the location, when it has formed a droplet, touch the droplet to the surface of the agar to transfer. Step 6b: Cover the plate and gently slide it to one side so as not to disturb the drops (or you get long, streaky plaques). As long as it is still near the blue flame, slide the lids partially to one side to speed up drying. DO NOT INVERT THE PLATE. It can take 20-30 mins outside of a flowhood for a droplet to dry, so we want to leave it as long as possible. Once the droplet is dry, any phages will diffuse through the agar and find their prey. Step 6c: Repeat the process with the remaining two plates and the remaining samples. As before, if you accidentally put a sample on the wrong spot, make a note of it so we can correct it later. Step 6d: When the last plate is dry, slide the lids back on and invert the plates. Bring the plates to the front and we will incubate them at 37 °C overnight to allow plaque formation. 2.2 Tuesday 25th May It’s plaque-picking day! Hopefully, at least one of your samples will have yielded a plaque on one of the hosts we have attempted. With a bit of luck, you are now the discoverer of a new virus (or viruses!). At this stage, there is the possibility that each plaque comprises a mixture of phages. If phages for the host are common in the sample, (e.g. E. coli phages in sewage), it’s quite likely that more than one suitable phage was in the original overnight inoculum. This is where infection efficiency comes into play in enrichment cultures - phages that replicate faster than other phages will produce more progeny. Following the first round of enrichment, the fastest phages will be the most abundant. The second round of enrichment in pure culture provides a second round of purifying selection. So, even if the initial sample had lots of suitable phages, it’s reasonably likely that by this stage, your lysate contains only one or two phages. So, if we are interested in recovering the maximum diversity of phages from a sample, then enrichment is not advised, if samples contain lots of different phages. To maximise diversity, the best way is to just do directly spot the original sample on a lawn of bacteria and look for different plaque morphologies. For our purposes, we use enrichment for two reasons: First, there are many hosts for which viruses are not common, so we need to amplify them up in order to isolate them. Second, even if a sample contains lots of suitable phages, the ones best suited for phage therapy are those that are the fastest replicating, most virulent phages for that host - i.e. the ones that would be victorious in purifying selection during enrichment. There is still the risk though that we have multiple fast replicating phages in our lysate. If we were to extract DNA from these now and then sequence them, we run the risk of combining the genomes of two phages. Even if we can assemble them into individual phage genomes, we could end up with a mixture of phages where one is suitable for therapeutic use and the other isn’t. So, we need to purify them into an axenic culture. We do this through something called ‘Dilution to Extinction’ purification. Briefly, we take a plaque sample, then use it to make a dilution series. We plate out each dilution in a spot assay until we can see individual plaques. We then pick a plaque that is from the greatest amount of dilution (lowest concentration of phages). It is possible that there could still be more than one phage in this plaque, if we were unlucky, so we repeat the process another two times. For the rest of this week, we will be performing these purification steps. Step 1: Make a fresh streak plate of your culture. Flame an inoculation loop until it glows red and then allow it to cool. Pick 3-4 colonies from your overnight streak plate by dabbing the loop on them. Streak them down one side of a petri dish containing LB + agar. Reflame your loop, allow to cool and drag one side perpendicular to the original streak. Turn your plate 90° and repeat. Label with your name, date and host name. Step 2: Make a fresh overnight culture for tomorrow’s plaque assays. Flame an inoculation loop until it glows red and then allow it to cool. Pick 3-4 colonies from your overnight streak plate by dabbing the loop on them. Transfer the loop into fresh LB medium in a sterilin. Reflame your loop. Label the sterilin with your name, date and host name. Bring the new streak plate and overnight culture to the front for us to incubate. Step 3: Collect your plates from the front and note the samples for which you have plaques. Make a record of the features of the plaque (We’ll take photos of each plate with plaques). How big is it? Plaque size is a function of how easily the virus diffuses through the medium (e.g. size) and how fast it replicates - plaques stop growing when the hosts reach stationary phase in the medium. The faster it replicates, the greater the number of replication cycles, the larger the plaque. Does it have a halo? A halo is a good indicator of a virulent phage with an explosive escape from the cell powered by lysins. Lysins continue to diffuse through the medium and kill hosts after the viral plaque has stopped growing, creating a halo. Is the centre clear or cloudy? Cloudy plaques are usually a good indicator of a temperate phage. Temperate phages confer superinfection immunity to the cell, preventing infection from other similar phages. Protected from lytic infection in this way, the cells can continue to replicate in the plaque, causing it to be cloudy. It doesn’t reach the same density as the surrounding lawn because the lytic/lysogenic switch is a stochastic process, so some killing continues. For each plaque on your plate you will need to perform the steps below. If your plate doesn’t have any plaques, we will assign you a plaque from a different plate. Step 4a: Label a microcentrifuge tube containing 100 µL of SM buffer with the number of the sample, the host and your name. Step 4b: Under a blue flame, take the lid off of your plate. Set a 1000 µL pipette to 200 µL. Using a blue pipette tip take a core of the plaque (we’ll show you how to do this) and eject the agar core into the 100 µL of SM buffer. Vortex the microcentrifuge tube for 2-3 seconds, leave for 5 minutes then vortex again for 2-3 seconds. The viruses will be released from the agar into the SM buffer. Step 5a: Into a 96 well plate, set up a dilution series in a row for each plaque you have picked. Pipette 90 µL of SM buffer into wells 2 through 11 (ignore columns 1 and 12). You can use the same pipette tip for each row. Step 5b: Pipette 100 µL from your microcentrifuge tube into column 1. Step 5c: Pipette 10 µL from column 1 into column 2 and mix with gentle pipetting. Step 5d: Pipette 10 µL from column 2 into column 3 and mix with gentle pipetting. Step 5e: Pipette 10 µL from column 3 into column 4 and mix with gentle pipetting. Step 5f: Repeat this process of adding 10 µL of mixture from column \\(n\\) into \\(n+1\\) and mixing until you’ve added 10 µL to column 11 and mixed. Step 5g: Change your pipette tip and do this each microcentrifuge tube you have, with each going into column 1 on a different row. Step 6a: Collect a bottom agar plate for every row you have filled on your 96-well plate. Step 6b: Divide it into quadrants and mark the locations of the dilution series as shown in the figure below. The numbers correspond to the columns of the plate. To convert to dilution factor, we subtract 1 and raise it to the power of 10, e.g. Position 1 is undiluted (\\(10^{0}\\)), Position 2 is a 10-fold dilution (\\(10^{1}\\)) etc. Label the plate with your name, the host name, the date and the sample number from which the plaque was picked. Step 7: Using the same protocol as yesterday, visit a pouring station and make a lawn of bacteria on your plates and allow to set for 15 mins before taking them back to your bench. Step 8: Using the same method as yesterday, spot 5 µL from each well in a row of your 96-well plate onto their assigned position on the plate. Onto the blank (B), pipette 5 µL of SM buffer. We want to make sure any ‘plaque’ is a result of viral infection, not an interaction with the buffer. Allow the spots to dry before inverting your plate and bringing it to the front for us to put in an incubator overnight. 2.3 Wednesday 26th May Hopefully, following overnight culture, your plates will look something like this: The next step is to core an individual plaque from the largest dilution number (e.g at \\(10^{-9}\\) here) and repeat the dilution to extinction process. Step 1: Make a fresh streak plate of your culture. Flame an inoculation loop until it glows red and then allow it to cool. Pick 3-4 colonies from your overnight streak plate by dabbing the loop on them. Streak them down one side of a petri dish containing LB + agar. Reflame your loop, allow to cool and drag one side perpendicular to the original streak. Turn your plate 90° and repeat. Label with your name, date and host name. Step 2: Make a fresh overnight culture for tomorrow’s plaque assays. Flame an inoculation loop until it glows red and then allow it to cool. Pick 3-4 colonies from your overnight streak plate by dabbing the loop on them. Transfer the loop into fresh LB medium in a sterilin. Reflame your loop. Label the sterilin with your name, date and host name. Bring the new streak plate and overnight culture to the front for us to incubate. Step 3: Label a microcentrifuge tube containing 100 µL of SM buffer with the number of the sample, the host and your name for each plate from yesterday. Step 4: Under a blue flame, take the lid off of your plate. Take a core of an individual plaque from the largest dilution number. If you have clearly distinct plaque morphologies at high dilutions, it could be an opportunity to isolate another phage, so let us know! Step 5: Add the core to the 100 µL of SM buffer, vortex, let sit and vortex again as you did yesterday. Step 6: Set up your dilution series on a 96-well plate as you did yesterday. Step 7: Collect your bottom agar plates and label them up as you did yesterday (date, sample, name, host, plus dilution well in quadrants). Step 8: Prepare your bacterial lawns at a pouring station. Step 9: Under a blue flame, spot 5 µL of each dilution onto the freshly set lawn in the appropriate position and allow to dry. 2.4 Thursday 27th May Final Round! Today we repeat what we did yesterday for the final round of purification. At the end of this, plaques are virtually certain to be axenic. 2.5 Friday 28th May We should now have plaques that are single axenic viral cultures. Now we need to bulk them up for sequencing and imaging and for making viral stocks for future use. Students will take a photo of their plates to record plaque morphology. These will also be used to determine approximate PFU counts. Students will pick plaque from the biggest dilution (fewest phages) and add it to 50 mL of LB + 10 mM \\(MgCl_{2}\\) + 10 mM \\(CaCl_{2}\\), amended with 1 mL of O/N host culture. Cultures will be grown O/N at 30 °C The next day (Saturday), BT and team will go in and centrifuge the samples down and prepare for each phage 1 x 50 mL tubes of lysate, filtered through a 0.2 µm syringe filter. We will prepare 3 x 2 mL phage stocks in acid washed, autoclaved amber glass vials. 200 µL of each phage filtrate will be provided to the imaging centre. 2.5.1 Materials required 3 x 50 mL LB + 10 mM \\(MgCl_{2}\\) + 10 mM \\(CaCl_{2}\\) (2L total) 3 x 50 mL falcon tubes (45 total) 3 x 0.2 µm syringe filter (45 total) 3 x 25 mL syringe with luer lock (45 total). 3 x 2 mL amber glass vials References "],["phage-purification-and-dna-extraction.html", "Week 3 Phage Purification and DNA extraction 3.1 Tuesday 1st June 3.2 Wednesday 2nd June 3.3 Thursday 3rd June 3.4 Friday 4th June", " Week 3 Phage Purification and DNA extraction TO BE UPDATED In the third week, the students will perform DNA extractions on phages 3.1 Tuesday 1st June Students will test their lysate for estimating PFU and begin phage DNA precipitation Students will prepare a dilution series of their phages as before and spot them in triplicate across 3 plates Students will transfer 30 mL of lysate to a fresh Falcon tube Students will add 15 µL of nuclease solution and incubate at 37 °C for 30 mins Students will then add 15 mL of precipitant solution to each tube and mix gently by inversion Samples will be incubated at 4 °C O/N 3.1.1 Materials required 10 mL pathogen culture 3 glass test tubes with lids containing 3 mL molten agar (45 total) 3 petri dishes with bottom agar (45 total) water bath (or heat blocks if the tubes will fit in). 1 sterile 96 well plate (15 total) 3 x Falcon tube (45 total) 50 µL of nuclease solution (750 µL total) 50 mL of precipitant solution (750 mL total) 3.2 Wednesday 2nd June Students will extract DNA using the Promega Wizard kit using this protocol Depending on how many phages we isolate, we are anticipating sending two per student for sequencing, with the remaining extractions kept back for future analyses. ### Materials required * 3 x 500 µL resuspension buffer (5 mM \\(MgSO_{4}\\)) (25 mL total) * 2 x Promega Wizard Kits. 3.3 Thursday 3rd June Students will perform killing efficiency assays of their phages.

Place on a magnetic stirrer for 1 min and allow to cool to RT. 4.3.4 A note on agar density thickness Abedon and Yin argue that because of modern agar extraction methods, contemporary agar is denser than old agar, so as a result plaques are smaller. They recommend instead using 1.0% agar in the bottom layer (10g per 1000 mL) and 0.65% agar in the top layer (6.5g in 1000 mL) (Abedon and Yin 2009). It is also recommended that plates are made fresh each time you need them (from microwaved agar), and that for spot assays, the phages are adsorbed to the agar as soon as it is gelled. The longer agar sits around, the drier and thus more dense it becomes. Bottom agar needs to be ~30 mL per 9cm petri dish. If it’s too thin, then the bottom agar doesn’t buffer the waste products from the top agar, nor nutrient replenishment, leading to premature termination of plaque growth. 4.4 Precipitant solution This is a ready-mixed 30% w/v PEG-8000, 3 M NaCl solution for adding to phage lysate in a 1:2 ratio precipitant:lysate (10%PEG-8000, 1 M NaCl final conc.) In a sterilized 500 mL bottle add 330 mL of autoclaved MilliQ and 105 g of NaCl and dissolve. Add 180g of PEG8000, cap bottle and shake. Incubate bottle in a 60 °C waterbath for 3 hours, shaking occasionally Remove and let cool to RT, shaking occasionally Add autoclaved MilliQ to 600 mL and store at RT. 4.5 Beef resuspension solution This is based on the recipe from (Williamson, Wommack, and Radosevich 2003). For each sample of 25g: To a 500 mL Duran add the following: 25g of beef extract 3.35g of \\(Na_{2}HPO_{4}\\cdot7H_{2}O\\) 0.3g of citric acid Add 250 mL of autoclaved MQ Add a stirrer bar Mix until completely dissolved and adjust pH to 7.2 References "],["protocols.html", "Protocols 4.6 Preparing phages from environmental samples 4.7 1. Initial phage enrichment (using 2.2 mL deep well plates or 7 mL sterilins)", " Protocols 4.6 Preparing phages from environmental samples Note: Due to the need to centrifuge samples in a fixed rotor, you can only process eight samples at any one time Please read all associated Risk Assessments related to the pathogens of interest before proceeding. 4.6.1 Solid Samples This method is adapted from (Guzmán et al. 2007). The proteins in the beef extract help phages desorb from solid material. Proteinaceous substances within the beef extract and those that desorb with the phages can interfere with downstream molecular analyses on large samples (e.g. PCR) (Göller et al. 2020), but for phage isolation, this isn’t a problem (and beef extract is more cost effective than using PBS + BSA). Aliquot 10-25g of sample into a 250 mL Duran, with a magnetic stirrer Add 1:10 w/v 10% beef resuspension solution (pH 7.2) Homogenise the sample by magnetic stirring for 20 mins at RT with sufficient speed to develop a vortex (500-900 rpm) Transfer to 50 mL falcon tubes or larger vessels and centrifuge at 4080 xg for 10 mins at 4 °C. This stage is just to get rid of the bulk material, so can be done in the benchtop centrifuge in GP211. Pass the supernatant through a Pluriselect 40 µm mesh filter into a fresh 50 mL Falcon tube to the 40 mL mark. Draw an arrow on the lid and mark the side where the pellet is going to be. Centrifuge at 10,000 xg for 30 mins at 4 °C. This requires the ThermoScientific Multifuge X3R on the 4th floor. In a flow hood, filter through a 0.2 µm PES filter into an acid-washed and autoclaved 20 mL amber glass vial (Fisher 11503552). You may have to re-centrifuge if it’s really clogging the filter. Use a luer-lock syringe and filter for this to avoid it popping off and spraying everywhere! You may need to use a second filter if it starts to clog. Label the glass vial with the What3Words label. Also on the side, write the date it was processed and your name. Store at 4 °C in the dark in the CPL sample box 4.6.2 Liquid Samples Aliquot sample into a 50 mL Falcon tube. Draw an arrow on the lid and mark the side where the pellet is going to be. Top up to 45 mL with pH 7.5 buffer if necessary Centrifuge at 10,000 xg for 30 mins at 4 °C. This requires the ThermoScientific Multifuge X3R on the 4th floor. Pour supernatant into 20 mL syringe fitted with 0.2 µm PES filter In a flow hood, filter through a 0.2 µm PES filter into an acid-washed and autoclaved 20 mL amber glass vial (Fisher 11503552).

Label the glass vial with the What3Words label. Also on the side, write the date it was processed and your name. Store at 4 °C in the dark in the CPL sample box 4.7 1. Initial phage enrichment (using 2.2 mL deep well plates or 7 mL sterilins) This method is based off this work (Olsen et al. 2020) and allows for the screening of one or more host strains against up to 94 samples (plus a blank and a positive control). Briefly, into each well we are adding LB medium into filtered sample that contains phages, then adding in an overnight culture of the pathogen of interest. If there are phages in the sample that infect the host, they will replicate and thus increase in abundance within the well. Subsequent steps then purify these enriched phages. For a negative control, you want to use a sample that has no phages in it. DI water is recommended for this. You also want to run a positive control (to show that phages can be amplified and plated). For this, you can use a phage lysate that has been previously isolated on the host of interest. Spike 10 µL of previous phage lysate into 1340 µL of DI water as your positive control. If you do not have a phage isolated on the pathogen of interest, it is recommended that you use a positive control consisting of 10 µL of T4 lysate into 1340 µL of DI. You will then need a well on your plate that contains an enrichment of E. coli BW25113. You’ll also need to include this in subsequent plaque assay steps. Make an O/N culture of your host of interest in LB medium at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. The required volume per host is 110 µL \\(\\times\\) the number of samples being tested, plus one negative control and one positive. So for 10 samples plus controls, you will need ~2 mL of host culture. Make a 40 mL solution of 0.25 M \\(CaCl_2\\) and 0.25 M \\(MgCl_2\\) as follows: 10 mL 1M \\(CaCl_2\\) 10 mL 1M \\(MgCl_2\\) 20 mL DI water Vortex and filter sterilize through a 0.22 µm syringe filter. The next day, unwrap an autoclaved 2.2 ml deep well 96-well plate (make sure you have the right ones! The wells are square. The ones with round wells don’t hold enough liquid) in a flow hood. Place 1350 µL of a 0.45 µm filtered sample into each well. For every strain of host, you need a negative control well (1350 µL of DI water). It’s worth thinking about the final spot plaque assays when laying out the plate. It’s easier to have a whole row or a whole column with a single host strain, as that way, you can spot an entire row/column onto the same plate, rather than having to cherry-pick samples. To each well, add 80 µL of a mixture of 0.25 M \\(CaCl_2\\) and 0.25 M \\(MgCl_2\\) To each well, add in 100 µL of an O/N culture of host To each well, add in 450 µL of 4.4x concentration LB (44g of LB in 400 mL) Pipette up and down to mix Cover with a plate film. Incubate overnight at 30 °C on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm. Set up another O/N culture of the hosts for the next day.
